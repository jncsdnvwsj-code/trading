Multi-Asset Exotic Option Pricing via GARCH-Copula Pipeline
Project Overview
This project implements a high-fidelity pricing engine for a "Worst-of" Put Option on a basket of mega-cap equities (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL). Unlike standard Black-Scholes models that assume constant volatility and linear correlations, this framework accounts for two critical market realities: Volatility Clustering and Asymmetric Tail Dependence.
